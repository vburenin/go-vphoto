# Photo Frame for Google Photos


I've been looking for a good software that could reliably show me random pictures
from my Google Photo albums on a full screen while running on Raspberry Pi.
I found nothing that would suite my simple needs. So, here we go. This is Go implementation
of a simple Google Photo viewer.
